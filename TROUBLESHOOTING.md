# To do list of improvements and new features for Soccer Predictor:

Analytics page:

- ML metrics plots need to be larger and easier to interpret, and there should be explanations of what each metric means.

Home page:

- Needs to be updated to reflect the new features of the tool and should have feature so that when user hovers over a upcoming match, or head-to-head, or cross-league, the card glows and pops up from the background so it is more interactive and engaging.

Models:

- There is a bias towards predicting draws in the matches. This needs to be updated accordingly and fixed because this is not representative of real-world outcomes and with what I am seeing in the ML metrics data for both train and test sets.
